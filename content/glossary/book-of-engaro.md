## Book of Engaro
#### Species: Orhatea

**Book of Engaro:** A book of orhatea history that encourages orhatea to hijack other species to find the next evolutionary leap. The results were often hideous and resulted in orhatea Colonies competing for species to hijack. Recognizing the degeneration of the orhatea, generations of Amahs forbade the book and merged the orhatea into a single Colony.
