## Angahai
#### Species: Orhatea

**Angahai** *(Ang guh hi)*: **The Universal Nature**. A belief system from the Book of Engaro that implies great evolutionary leaps are the only method the Universe has to reveal its purpose. Those not interested in finding ways to evolve the species into something greater are lesser and therefore tools for those who believe. While forbidding the Book of Engaro, the orhatea have adopted parts of this belief system by considering any species that cannot survive in space as a lesser species, referring to them as planet-bound, a derogatory term.
