## Amah
#### Species: Orhatea

**Amah** *(ah ma)*: **Mother, or queen**. The proper name and title for an orhatea female that has formed a Colony. The orhatea are eusocial, with a single queen (the Amah) directing the Colony’s activities, especially the use of a female’s eggs and a male’s seed. An Amah’s egg when paired with Earah’s seed will produce a sexed orhatea. All other pairings of eggs and seed produce unsexed orhatea.

The Amah is a powerful being. She can grow to 243 cm (8 ft) in height. Her enlarged body structure makes her incredibly strong and allows for added air sacks that can produce a sonic attack capable of shattering concrete and melting steel. Like all female orhatea, she is a powerful telepath, but unlike the Tomo, she can reach into the minds of species not hatched from arotea.

The Amah is the only member of an orhatea Colony that has freewill. The Colony’s children are an extension of that will, and behave as if they were a single individual, executing the Amah’s desires.
