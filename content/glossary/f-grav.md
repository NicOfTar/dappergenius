## F-Grav
#### Species: Human

F-Grav is a combination of paramagnetic and diamagnetic fields that simulate gravity on Explorer Corporation orbital platforms, spaceships, space stations, and low gravity colonies. In a zero-gravity environment the emitters can reproduce one-half Earth gravity. The created fields are space dependent, therefor they can be on in one room and off in another, or switched from on to off and back again in rapid succession. This allows for the movement of heavy cargo in a low gravity environment while it is secured in a heavier gravity environment.

The name is from a modified gravity theory that generalizes the theory of relativity to eliminate the need for dark energy and dark matter.
