## Arotea Ting
#### Species: Orhatea

**Arotea Ting** *(ay row tea ting)*: **Harvest Eaters**. An orhatea drone meant that produces arotea. They are both bi-sexual and incapable of sex. Their sexual organs aid in the digestion of food which accelerates the production of pure arotea. They grow to colossal sizes and are incapable of movement. Incapable of expelling of the arotea they produce, they are slaughtered, their shells cracked open in seasonal ceremonies, their arotea collected and stored, and their shells discarded.
