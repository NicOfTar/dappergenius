## Anga
#### Species: Orhatea

**Anga** *(ang guh):* **Fate, destiny**. Fate is a religious belief. For the orhatea, believers are planet-bound, superstitious fools. Yet, their very name, The Fundamental Beings of the Universe implies a certain weight in destiny. The Book of Engaro asserts the orhatea have not completed their evolutionary journey, promising a new—all-powerful—species, the Engaro. But that leap is dependent on the anga of another species they have yet to meet.
