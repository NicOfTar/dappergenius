## Earah
#### Species: Orhatea

**Earah** *(ear rha)*: **Pledged male, or prince**. The proper name given to the male ruler of the orhatea. He is the primary caretaker of the colony, responsible for its day-to-day functions, protection and expansion. He is the final arbiter in all disputes, and with the exception of Amah, his word is law.

The Earah is a powerful being. He can grow to 217 cm (7â€™) in height. His enlarged body structure makes him incredibly strong. Male orhatea have limited telepathic abilities compared to the female, but unlike the females they are capable of manipulating computer systems with a thought. Male orhatea can create an energy charge over their shells, and the Earah can extend that into a blade of plasma capable of slicing through concrete and steel.
