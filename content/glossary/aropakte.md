## Aropakte
#### Species: Orhatea

**Aropakte** *(ay row pawch tea)*: **Motherless**. Being part of the colony, a child of the Amah is the definition of purpose for an orhatea. Aropakte is both a derision and a punishment for a drone. Aropakte are forbidden to lay or hatch eggs, or make Tomo clones, or—for males—to share their seed with a female. Sexless drones given the aropakte tag are ruthlessly humiliated and abused.
