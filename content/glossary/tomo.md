## Tomo
#### Species: Orhatea

**Tomo** *(toe mow)*: **Infiltrator, female**. Female orhatea (not reserved for the expansion of the Colony) are adept at creating clones of lesser species to undermine, or manipulate intelligent species until they are willing to accept the orhatea as their rulers.

To create a clone, a Tomo implants genetic material into one of her eggs and places the egg in a tank of arotea. With careful attending, the Tomo can create a clone of any species. A combination of aro and arotea grows the clone at an accelerated pace. Once created, the Tomo controls the clone through a telepathic link. With some planning, memory, and personality of one clone can be transferred to a new body.
