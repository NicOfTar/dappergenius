## Arotea
#### Species: Orhatea

**Arotea** *(ay row tea)*: **Liquid Life**. A Royal jelly and super-food that is the purpose of an orhatea Colony. The amber colored liquid is food for sexless drones, with an abdomen full of the liquid they can survive for months. Tomo use arotea to grow clones and it enables the telepathic connection between Tomo and clone. Male—Tamo—are superpowered by the liquid becoming fierce warriors, ten times faster and stronger than usual.

For other species arotea’s effects are less pronounced until the individual has adapted to the substance. Once adapted the effects are variable and unpredictable, with beneficial effects often followed by a painful and sudden death.
