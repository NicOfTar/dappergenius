## Angatam
#### Species: Orhatea

**Angatam** *(ang guh tam)*: **The final parting**, or the birth of the sisters. Fertility is life to the orhatea. Females and males live as long as they can produce eggs or seed. For aktai that could be a few years, for Tomo and Tamo it could be hundreds of years, and for the Amah and Earah it could be a thousand or more years.

When a lesser male or female are no longer fertile they are fed to the Arotea Ting. When an Amah is barren she kills her Earah then joins her psychic essence to his in her Seed. After which, her body divides into two females, one of which will assume the role of Amah after killing the other. This period of conflict decimates the Colony is the only known limit to orhatea expansion.
