## Aktai
#### Species: Orhatea

**Aktai** *(Ach tie)*: **Breeder**. A derogatory term used for any sexed orhatea that is not pledged to another. *Breeder* here is derogatory in the sense that unpledged sexed orhatea must give their eggs or seed to the orhatea hatching chambers for the creation of sexless drones. Whereas, a paired maleâ€™s female uses his seed to create aro, and Tomo clones, a higher honor.
