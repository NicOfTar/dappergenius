## Tamo
#### Species: Orhatea

**Tamo** *(ta mow)*: **Warrior**. All male orhatea are some version of Tamo. Their level and importance to the Colony is decided through combat. Tamo have limited telepathic abilities that are enhanced when they pledge themselves to a female. Unlike females, however, they can manipulate computer systems with their thoughts. In addition, they can turn their shells into weapons, generating a current that acts a shield, and makes the Tamo impossible to touch.
