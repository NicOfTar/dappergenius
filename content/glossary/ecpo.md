**ECPO:** *Explorer Corporation Police Operations.* Originally considered by Charles Clark as a paramilitary force to subdue the United States government, he abandoned the idea when the US joined Explorer Corporation. Earl Clark reopened the project when research proved that a belief and loyalty system could be mapped onto a human brain. The project was abandoned again as Explorer Bridge neared completion. Michael Planck ordered the creation of the force after Earl Clarkâ€™s death at Eris Station, putting first Mark Lamar, then Park Sato in command of the force.
