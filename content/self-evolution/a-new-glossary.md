title: .//Self-Evolution/Notes - A New Glossary
---

Sometimes the tool comes to you. WordPress is a robust platform but it has a few quirks that get under the skin of experienced coders. Everything is a *post* is a fine model, but after seventeen years you should be able to display those posts in dynamic ways. Sure there are plugins, but WordPress is the platform, and a platform that doesn't you give the tools for most basic element of its existence is weak.

With a little PHP code, the REST hooks, and some JavaScript I could extend a theme and build a fancy sort for my posts. That I have to do this is just maddening, and I don't want to do that much work on my site when I could *be writing* instead.

A rule I learned as a software architect was to reduce the toolset, and choose tools built by people passionate about their work. There are fewer of those in the WordPress community than you might think. Yootheme is one of the good ones, and this year they have been hitting home runs.

The Explorers adds two new species to The Fundamentals Universe. That means two new cultures with unique languages and backgrounds. Even I need a reference to keep up, or at least be consistent. So thanks to Yootheme, a custom post type, and some custom fields here is an enhanced glossary to The Fundamentals Universe. The tabs across the top allow you to filter the glossary by species. A much better experience than scrolling through a long list of WordPress posts, sorted, well, not very well. Enjoy!
